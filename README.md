# Doki Doki Extended Github Repository
## Snapshots are now a thing!
> Now releasing somewhat regularly is "**Snapshots**" for development updates with a copy of the mod files. If you're somewhat familliar with Minecraft's snapshot naming process, the naming process for our snapshots are basically the same.
> 
> **Naming Process:**
> The first 2 numbers are always the last 2 numbers of the year.
> The "w" stands for "week."
> The second set of numbers is the week number. (If a snapshot releases on January 3rd, 2022, it would be named 22w01a).
> Note: The last letter is just a differentiating factor if multiple snapshots come out in a week.
